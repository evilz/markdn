# About This Project

This is a demonstration of the Markdown to Razor pre-build generator.

## Features

- YAML front-matter parsing
- Markdig conversion
- Automatic routing
- Page title generation

## How It Works

The generator runs before the Razor compilation and creates physical `.razor` files from Markdown sources.
